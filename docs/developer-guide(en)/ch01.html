<h1>Chapter 1. Introduction</h1>
<p><b>The StarUML&#8482; Developer Guide</b> provides essential information for 
developers to use the extension mechanism of StarUML&#8482;, a UML-based software 
modeling platform, to develop StarUML&#8482; Add-Ins.</p>
<h2>StarUML OverView</h2>
<p>StarUML&#8482; is a software modeling platform which supports UML (Unified Modeling 
Language). It is based on UML version 1.4 and provides UML version 2.0 notations 
and eleven different types of diagram. It actively supports the MDA (Model 
Driven Architecture) approach by supporting the UML profile concept. StarUML&#8482; is 
excellent in customizability to the user¡¯s environment and has a high 
extensibility in its functionality.</p>

<h3>UML Tool which Adjusts to the User<span lang="EN-US">
</span></h3>
<p>StarUML&#8482; provides maximum customization to the user¡¯s environment by offering 
customizing variables that can be applied in the user¡¯s software development 
methodology, project platform, and language.</p>
<h3>True MDA Support</h3>
<p>Software architecture is a critical process that can reach 10 years or more 
into the future. The intention of the OMG (Object Management Group) is to use 
MDA (Model Driven Architecture) technology to create platform independent models 
and allow automatic acquisition of platform dependent models or codes from 
platform independent models. StarUML&#8482; complies truly with UML 1.4 standards and 
supports UML 2.0 notations. It provides the UML Profile concept, allowing 
creation of platform independent models. Users can easily obtain their end 
products with simple scripting through external COM interfaces or writing 
document template.</p>
<h3>Excellent Extensibility and Flexibility</h3>
<p>StarUML&#8482; provides excellent extensibility and flexibility. It provides Add-In 
frameworks for extending the functionality of the tool. It is designed to allow 
access to all functions of the model/meta-model and tool through COM Automation, 
and it provides extension of menu and option items. Also, users can create their 
own approaches and frameworks according to their methodologies. The tool can 
also be integrated with any external tools.</p>
<h2>Why UML/MDA Platform</h2>
<p>StarUML&#8482; is a Software Modeling Platform. Why do we need a modeling platform 
rather than just a UML tool?</p>
<ul>
	<li>End users want customizable tools. Providing a variety of customizing 
	variables to meet the requirements of the user environment can ensure high 
	productivity and quality.</li>
	<li>No modeling tool provides a complete set of all possible 
	functionalities. A good tool must allow future addition of functions to 
	protect the user¡¯s investment costs in purchasing the tool.</li>
	<li>MDA (Model Driven Architecture) technology requires not only independent 
	platforms but multi-platform functionality. Modeling tools confined to 
	specific development environments are not suitable for MDA. The tool itself 
	should become a modeling platform to provide functionality for various 
	platform technologies and tools.</li>
	<li>Integration with other tools is vital for maximization of the tool¡¯s 
	efficiency. The tool must provide a high level of extensibility, and allow 
	integration with existing tools or user¡¯s legacy tools.</li>
</ul>
