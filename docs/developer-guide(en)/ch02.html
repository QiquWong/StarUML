<h1>Chapter 2. StarUML Architecture</h1>
<p>This chapter discusses the basic architecture of StarUML&#8482;. It mainly 
describes the structures of the platform architecture, Add-Ins, and external 
API.</p>
<h2>Platform Architecture</h2>
<p>StarUML&#8482; is an extensible software modeling platform; it does not just 
provide pre-defined functions but allows addition of new functions. The diagram 
below illustrates the architecture of StarUML&#8482;. Blue indicates the platform and 
green the extensible parts. The extensible parts can be developed by the user or 
a third party and then added to the platform for integration.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Approach</b>:&nbsp;Approach defines the model of the 
	project and basic organization of the diagrams. For details on approach, see
	<b>&quot;<a href="ch05.html">Chapter 5. Writing Approaches</a>&quot;.</b></li>
	<li><b>UML Profile &amp; Notation Extension </b>: UML Profile allows extension of 
	expression for the software model through the extension mechanism of UML. 
	For details on UML profile, see <b>&quot;<a href="ch07.html">Chapter 7. Writing UML 
	Profiles</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="ch10.html">Chapter 10. Extending Notation</a>&quot;</b></li>
	<li><b>Model Framework</b>: Model Framework makes software models reusable 
	and allows them to be used when defining other software models. For details 
	on model framework, see <b> &quot;<a href="ch06.html">Chapter 
	6. 
	Writing Frameworks</a>&quot;.</b></li>
	<li><b>Add-In COM Object</b>: Add-In COM allows addition of new 
	functionality to StarUML&#8482;. For details on Add-In COM objects, see <b>&quot;<a href="ch09.html">Chapter 
	9. Writing Add-In COM Object</a>&quot;. </b></li>
	<li><span lang="EN-US"><b>Menu Extension</b>: The StarUML&#8482; application menu 
	(main menu and pop-up menu) can be added by the user. For details on menu 
	extension, see </span><b>&quot;<a href="ch08.html">Chapter 8. Extending Menu</a>&quot;.</b></li>
	<li><b>Option Extension</b>: The StarUML&#8482; option items can be added by the 
	user. For details on option extension, see<b> 
	&quot;<a href="ch09.html">Chapter 9. Writing Add-in COM Object</a>&quot;.</b></li>
	<li><b>Event Subscription</b>: Various events occurring in StarUML&#8482; can be 
	subscribed to. For details on subscribing to events, see <b>&quot;<a href="ch09.html">Chapter 9. Writing Add-in COM Object</a>&quot;.</b></li>
	<li><b>External API</b>: The external API from StarUML&#8482; allows access to 
	various functionalities and information. Details on API are discussed 
	throughout this developer guide, and the example included in StarUML&#8482; 
	installation <b>'StarUML Application Model.uml' </b>provides a good 
	illustration. See <b>&quot;Appendix A. 
	Plastic Application Model.&quot;</b></li>
</ul>
<h2>Organizing a Module</h2>
<p>Module is a software package which allows addition of new functionalities and 
features by extending StarUML&#8482;. Module consists of various extension mechanisms 
of StarUML&#8482;. As illustrated in the diagram below, an Add-In package can consist 
of various approaches, various model frameworks, various UML profiles, various 
scripts, menu extensions, option extensions, help, and Add-In COM Objects.</p>
<p>

<h3>Application of Modules</h3>
<p>Modules can contain various elements, it can be developed for different 
purposes. Modules can be used for supporting specific processes, languages or 
platforms, integrating with other tools, or extending functions.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Support for Specific Processes</b>: UML Components, RUP, Catalysis, 
	XP, ...</li>
	<li><b>Support for Specific Programming Languages</b>: C/C++, Python, C#, 
	Visual Basic, Java, Perl, Object Pascal, ...</li>
	<li><b>Integration with Specific Tools</b>: Visual SourceSafe, CVS, MS Word, 
	Eclipse, Visual Studio.NET, ...</li>
	<li><b>Extension of Other Functionalities</b>: Traceability Manager, Design 
	Patterns Support, Rule Checking, ...</li>
	<li><b>Building Individual (or Enterprise) Specific Environment</b></li>
</ul>
<h3>Elements of Module</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Approach</b>: Approach is applied in the beginning of the project to 
	determine the initial model structure. For example, when making an Add-In 
	for a specific process, approach can be used to pre-define the structure 
	which manages the models produced at each stage of the process.</li>
	<li><b>Model Framework</b>: When developing a module related to specific 
	languages or platforms, model framework can produce Class Library or 
	Application Framework. Other basic services (e.g. Event, Transaction, 
	Security, Directory, ...) can also be developed and added as models.</li>
	<li><b>UML Profile</b>: UML Profile can be defined to extend expression of 
	UML for specific processes, languages or frameworks, or to use additional 
	properties. This has a global effect in the module. </li>
	<li><b>Menu Extension</b>: Menu Extension is used to add most of the new 
	functionality in Add-In, and to extend the main menu or pop-up menu to allow 
	the user to select and run the functions. This is a critical element in 
	Add-In development. </li>
	<li><b>Option Extension</b>: Add-In itself can have various selection items. 
	Utilizing them allows use of option dialogs in StarUML&#8482; as option items.</li>
	<li><b>Add-In COM Object</b>: Extensible functionalities can be created 
	using languages and tools like Visual Basic, Delphi, Visual C++, and C#. In 
	general, COM objects are used for additional GUI or complex functionalities, 
	and Scripts are used for simple functionalities. This is usually programmed 
	through external API. </li>
	<li><b>Script</b>: Simple functionality extension can be done by using 
	Scripting Languages (JScript, VBScript, Python, ...). This is usually 
	programmed through external API.</li>
	<li><b>Help</b>: Help for Add-In can be created as HTML and registered with 
	local or remote path.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Open API Overview</h2>
<p>StarUML&#8482; provides a wide array of API (Application 
Programming Interface). The external API of StarUML&#8482; 
is a standardized programming interface that allows use of the internal program 
functionalities from outside. </p>
<p>As illustrated in the diagram below, the external API of StarUML&#8482; can be 
divided into three main parts: <b>Modeling Elements</b>, <b>Non_Modeling 
Elements</b> and <b>Application Objects</b>. The <b>Modeling Elements</b> part 
provides an interface for access to modeling elements, and the <b>Non_Modeling 
Elements</b> part provides an interface for MOF (Meta-Object Facility) and 
various elements other than modeling elements. The <b>Application Objects</b> 
part provides various interfaces which manage the application itself.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="images/ch02.h3.jpg"></p>
<h3>The Application Objects Part</h3>
<p>The <b>Application Objects</b> part includes interfaces which manage the 
application itself. The interfaces included in this part are <b>
IStarUMLApplication </b>as the basic interface, <b>ISelectionManager </b>for 
managing element selection, <b>IUMLFactory </b>for creating elements, <b>
IProjectManager</b> for managing projects, and interfaces related to events and 
GUI.</p>
<h3>The Modeling Elements Part</h3>
<p>The <b>Modeling Elements</b> part includes interfaces for managing modeling 
elements. This part can be further divided into many parts. The <b>Core Elements</b> 
part defines the top interface of model, view, and diagram elements. The <b>
ExtCore Elements</b> part includes interfaces for extensible model elements, and 
the <b>UML Model Elements</b> part defines the UML modeling elements based on 
the ExtCore Elements. The <b>ViewCore Elements</b> part includes interfaces for 
basic components of view elements, and the <b>UML View Elements</b> part also 
defines the UML view elements based on the ViewCore Elements.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="images/ch02.h4.jpg"></p>
<h3>The Non_Modeling Elements Part</h3>
<p>The <b>Non_Modeling Elements</b> part includes interfaces for elements other 
than modeling elements. This part can be further divided into many parts: the <b>
Extension Elements</b> part which includes interfaces for elements related to 
the UML extension mechanism, the Document Elements part which manages StarUML&#8482;¡¯s 
saved files, and the <b>Metamodeling Elements</b> part which manages meta-level 
elements.</p>
