<h2>What is StarUML</h2>
<p>StarUML&#8482; is a software modeling platform that supports UML (Unified Modeling 
Language). It is based on UML version 1.4 and provides eleven
different types of 
diagram, 
and it accepts UML 2.0 notation<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">.</span>
It actively supports the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) approach by 
supporting the UML profile concept. StarUML&#8482; excels in customizability to the 
user¡¯s environment and has a high extensibility in its functionality. Using 
StarUML&#8482;, one of the top leading software modeling tools, will guarantee to 
maximize the productivity and quality of your software projects.</p>
<h3>UML 
Tool that Adapts to the User</h3>
<p>StarUML&#8482; provides maximum customization to the user¡¯s environment by offering 
customizing variables that can be applied in the user¡¯s software development 
methodology, project platform, and language.</p>
<h3>True 
MDA Support</h3>
<p>Software architecture is a critical process that can reach 10 years or more into 
the future. The intention of the OMG (Object Management Group) is to use MDA 
(Model Driven Architecture) technology to create platform independent models and 
allow automatic acquisition of platform dependent models or codes from platform 
independent models. StarUML&#8482; truly complies with UML 1.4 standards, UML 
2.0 notation and provides the UML Profile concept, allowing creation of 
platform independent models. <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF">Users can 
easily obtain their end products through simple template document.</span></p>
<h3>Excellent Extensibility and Flexibility</h3>
<p>StarUML&#8482; provides excellent extensibility and flexibility. It provides Add-In 
frameworks for extending the functionality of the tool. It is designed to allow 
access to all functions of the model/meta-model and tool through COM Automation, 
and it provides extension of menu and option items. Also, users can create their 
own approaches and frameworks according to their methodologies. The tool can 
also be integrated with any external tools.</p>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<p>StarUML&#8482; has the following new features.</p>

		StarUML&#8482; strictly adheres to the UML standard specification specified by 
		the OMG for software modeling. Considering the fact that the results of 
		design information can reach 10 years or more into the future, 
		dependence on vendor-specific irregular UML syntax and semantics can be 
		quite risky. StarUML&#8482; 
		maximizes itself to order UML 1.4 standard and meaning, and it accepts 
		UML 2.0 notation on the basis of robust meta model<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">.</span></td>

		Unlike many existing products that manage their own legacy format models 
		inefficiently, StarUML&#8482; manages all files in the standard XML format. 
		Codes written in easy-to-read structures and their formats can be 
		changed conveniently by using the XML parser. Given the fact that XML is 
		a world standard, this is certainly a great advantage, ensuring that the 
		software models remain useful for more than a decade.</td>
