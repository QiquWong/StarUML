<h3>Actor</h3>
<h4>Semantics</h4>
<p>An actor defines a coherent set of roles that users of an entity can play 
when interacting with the entity. An actor may be considered to play a separate 
role with regard to each use case with which it communicates.</p>
<h4>Procedure for creating Actor</h4>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In order to 
create Actor, click <b>[Toolbox] -&gt; [UseCase] -&gt; [Actor] </b>button and click the position 
where to place Actor. Actor is shown in the form of stick man or rectangle with 
icon, that is decoration view. To display actor in decoration view, </span>
select <b>[Format] -&gt; [Stereotype Display] -&gt; 
[Decoration]</b> menu item or select <b>[Decoration]</b> item in
[<img border="0" src="images/ch05_110.jpg">] combo button on toolbar.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_111.jpg"></p>
<h4>Procedure for creating multiple UseCases used by Actor at once</h4>
<p>In order to create multiple UseCases related to Actor at once, use shortcut 
creation syntax of Actor. </p>
<ol>
	<li>At the Actor's quick dialog, enter UseCase's name 
after &quot;-()&quot; string. To create multiple UseCases, enter same but separate 
UseCase's name by &quot;,&quot; character.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_112.jpg"></li>
	<li>And press <b>[Enter]</b> key. Several UseCases associated with the Actor are 
created and arranged vertically.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_113.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<h3>UseCase</h3>
<h4>Semantics</h4>
<p>The use case construct is used to define the behavior of a system or other 
semantic entity without revealing the entity¡¯s internal structure. Each use case 
specifies a sequence of actions, including variants, that the entity can 
perform, interacting with actors of the entity.</p>
<h4>Procedure for creating UseCase</h4>
<p>In order to create UseCase, click <b>[Toolbox]</b> -&gt; <b>[UseCase]</b> button 
and <span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana">click the 
position where to place UseCase on the <b>[main window]</b>.</span></p>
<p>UseCase is expressed in the forms of textual, decoration, iconic. To change 
UseCase's view style, select menu item under <b>[Format] -&gt; 
[Stereotype Display]</b> or select [<img border="0" src="images/ch05_114.jpg"> ]button's combo item.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_115.jpg"></p>
<h4>Procedure for adding Extension</h4>
<p>An extension point references one or a collection of locations in a use case 
where the use case may be extended.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_116.jpg"><br>
To edit ExtensionPoints of UseCase, click UseCase's <b>[Collection Editor...]</b> 
popup menu or click <img border="0" src="images/ch05_117.jpg"> 
button of <b>[ExtensionPoints]</b> collection property.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_118.jpg"> </p>
<h4>Procedure for entering UseCase specification</h4>
<p>To enter basic flow, alternative flow properties of usecase, select <b>[Tagged 
Values...]</b> popup menu or click <b>[Ctrl+F7]</b> button. At tagged value editor, 
select<b> [UseCaseSpecification] </b>item and enter the properties.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_119.jpg"></p>
<h4>Procedure for creating Actor from UseCase</h4>
<p>In order to create multiple Actors related to UseCase at once, use shortcut 
creation syntax. </p>
<ol>
	<li>Double-click UseCase, or select UseCase and press <b>[Enter]</b> 
key. At quick dialog, enter Actor's name after &quot;()-&quot; string and separate Actor 
names by &quot;,&quot; character.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_120.jpg"></li>
	<li>And press <b>[Enter]</b> key. Several Actors associated with the UseCase are 
created and arranged vertically. <br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_121.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<h3>Association / Derected Association</h3>
<h4>Semantics</h4>
<p>A association is an association among exactly two classifiers (including the 
possibility of an association from a classifier to itself).</p>
<h4>Procedure for creating association</h4>
<p>In order to create association, click <b>[Toolbox] -&gt; [UseCase] -&gt; [Association]</b> 
button, drag from first element, and drop to second element in the<b> [main 
window]</b>.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_122.jpg"></p>
<h4>Procedure for creating directed association</h4>
<p>The procedure is equal to the association's, drag and drop in the arrow 
direction.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_123.jpg"></p>
<p>Or create association, click the actor-side association end. At the quick 
dialog, uncheck navigable and association becomes directed.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_124.jpg"></p>
<h4>Procedure for creating element related to association/directed assocition</h4>
<p>In order to create element associated with current element, use shortcut 
creation syntax. </p>
<ol>
	<li>Double-click element and enter element's names associated after 
&quot;--&quot; or &quot;-&gt;&quot; string at the quick dialog. Separate element names with &quot;,&quot; 
character to relate multiple elements.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_125.jpg"></li>
	<li>Press <b>[Enter]</b> key and several elements associated with selected 
element are 
created and arranged automatically. <br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_126.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<h3>Generalization</h3>
<h4>Semantics</h4>
<p>Generalization is the taxonomic relationship between a more general element 
(the parent) and a more specific element (the child) that is fully consistent 
with the first element and that adds additional information.</p>
<h4>Procedure for creating generalization</h4>
<p>In order to make generalization, click <b>[Toolbox] -&gt; [UseCase] 
-&gt;[Generalization]</b> button, drag from child element and drop to parent element in 
the <b>[main window]</b>.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_127.jpg"></p>
<h4>Procedure for creating multiple child actors inherited from actor</h4>
<p>To create multiple elements inherited from some element, </p>
<ol>
	<li>Enter with &quot;&lt;=&quot; 
string as following at the quick dialog, and several elements inherited from 
selected element are created at once.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_128.jpg"></li>
	<li>Child elements are generated below selected element and arranged 
automatically.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_129.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to create multiple parent element at once, enter &quot;=&gt;&quot; string 
instead of &quot;&lt;=&quot; in the quick dialog.</p>
<h3>Dependency</h3>
<h4>Semantics</h4>
<p>A <i>dependency</i> is a type of relationship that signifies that one 
element, or group of elements, acting as the client depends on another element 
or group of elements that act as a supplier. It is a weak relationship that 
denotes that if the supplier is changed the client may be affected. It is a 
unidirectional relationship.</p>
<h4>Procedure for creating dependency</h4>
<p>In order to create dependency, click <b>[Toolbox] -&gt; [UseCase] -&gt; [Dependency] 
</b>button, drag element and drop to other element depended.</p>
<h4>Procedure for creating other usecase depended by current usecase</h4>
<p>Enter with &quot;--&gt;&quot; string at the quick dialog as following.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_130.jpg"></p>
<p>So dependency relationship is created between two elements.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_131.jpg"></p>
<h3>Include</h3>
<h4>Semantics</h4>
<p>An include relationship defines that a use case contains the behavior defined 
in another use case.</p>
<h4>Procedure for creating include</h4>
<p>In order to create include relationship, click <b>[Toolbox] -&gt; [UseCase] -&gt; 
[Include]</b> button, drag from element including and drop to element included in 
the <b>[main window]</b>.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_132.jpg"></p>
<h4>Procedure for creating other usecase included by current usecase</h4>
<p>Enter with &quot;-i&gt;&quot; string at the quick dialog as following.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_133.jpg"></p>
<p>So include relationship is created between two elements.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_134.jpg"></p>
<h3>Extend</h3>
<h4>Semantics</h4>
<p>An extend relationship defines that instances of a use case may be augmented 
with some additional behavior defined in an extending use case.</p>
<h4>Procedure for creating extend</h4>
<p>In order to create extend, click <b>[Toolbox] -&gt; [UseCase] -&gt; [Extend]</b> button, 
drag from element extending and drop to element extended in the <b>[main window]</b>.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_135.jpg"></p>
<h4>Procedure for creating other usecase extending current usecase</h4>
<p>Enter with &quot;&lt;e-&quot; string at the quick dialog as following.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_136.jpg"></p>
<p>So extend relationship is created between two elements.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_137.jpg"></p>
<h3>System Boundary</h3>
<h4>Semantics</h4>
<p>A <i>System Boundary</i> is a type of partition that represents the boundary 
between the thing you are representing with the use cases (inside the boundary) 
and the actors (outside the boundary). Its most typical usage is the boundary of 
an entire system. Use cases can be used to represent subsystems and classes and 
so the boundary may be more specific than an entire system. A package with a 
stereotype <i>topLevel</i> can be used as a boundary and name space within the 
use case model to denote the same thing as the <i>use case boundary</i>.</p>
<h4>Procedure for creating system boundary</h4>
<p>In order to create system boundary, click <b>[Toolbox] -&gt; [UseCase] -&gt; [System 
Boundary]</b> button, drag from the starting point of system boundary and drag to 
right-bottom point of system boundary.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ch05_138.jpg"></p>
<h3>Package</h3>
<h4>Semantics</h4>
<p>A package is a grouping of model elements. Packages themselves may be nested 
within other packages. A package may contain subordinate packages as well as 
other kinds of model elements. All kinds of UML model elements can be organized 
into packages. </p>
<h4>Procedure for creating package</h4>
<p>In order to create package, click <b>[Toolbox] -&gt; [UseCase] -&gt; [Package]</b> button 
and click at the location where package will be placed in the <b>[main window]</b>.</p>
